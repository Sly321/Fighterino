Comments:
  My third released Bg.
  Better than my last one, I guess. Though it's made in a cheap way (All layer merged in one and that one layer animated in 20 frames). But, if you don't lag with it, you'll be ok xD
  The thing that I like about it are the lake and waterfall animations. Both at the same time were kinda hard but I think the outcome looks good =p
  Still some people told me that it's very symetric, but I won't do twice the work. Also the waterfalls are kinda in a wrong perspective, but they are already done and rotate them a little would be a time consuming thing...
